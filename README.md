#### ShaServer
A high-performance network proxy tool based on the libevent framework. 
It uses the libevent framework to handle network I/O, 
providing an efficient event driven model that can handle a large number of concurrent connections. 
And it supports secure encryption and reliable data, 
aiming to provide a simple, fast, and secure network proxy solution.

Furthermore, this project only exists for the purpose of learning network programming
